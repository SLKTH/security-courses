\slide{Hackerlab Setup}

\hlkimage{7cm}{hacklab-1.png}

\begin{list2}
\item Hardware: modern laptop CPU with virtualisation\\
Dont forget to enable hardware virtualisation in the BIOS
\item Software Host OS: Windows, Mac, Linux
\item Virtualisation software: VMware, Virtual box, HyperV pick your poison
\item Hackersoftware: Kali Virtual Machine \link{https://www.kali.org/}
\item Production use: Debian Linux \link{https://www.debian.org/}
\end{list2}



\slide{Networking Hardware}

If you want to do exercises and work with networks \\
It will be an advantage to have a wireless USB network card and an USB Ethernet card.

The following are two models I have used:
\begin{list2}
\item TP-link TL-WN722N hardware version 2.0 cheap
\item Alfa AWUS036ACH 2.4GHz + 5GHz Dual-Band and high performing
\item Often you need to compile drivers yourself, and research a bit
\end{list2}

Getting an USB card allows you to use the regular one for the main OS, and insert the USB into the virtual machine



\slide{Network Security Monitoring -- Intrusion Detection}

\hlkimage{4cm}{network-security-monitoring.png}

\begin{list1}
\item Network Security Monitoring (NSM) - monitoring networks for intrusions, and reacting to those
\item networkbased intrusion detection systems (NIDS)
\item host based intrusion detection systems (HIDS)
\item Example full systems are Security Onion \link{https://securityonion.net/} or\\ SELKS \link{https://www.stamus-networks.com/open-source/}
\end{list1}

\slide{False Positives}

\begin{list2}
\item True Positive (TP). An alert that has correctly identified a specific activity. If a signature was designed to detect a certain type of malware, and an alert is generated when that malware is launched on a system, this would be a true positive, which is what we strive for with every deployed signature.Indicators of Compromise and Signatures
\item False Positive (FP). An alert has incorrectly identified a specific activity. If a signature was designed to detect a specific type of malware, and an alert is generated for an instance in which that malware was not present, this would be a false positive.
\item True Negative (TN). An alert has correctly not been generated when a specific activity has not occurred. If a signature was designed to detect a certain type of malware, and no alert is generated without that malware being launched, then this is a true negative, which is also desirable. This is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify in terms of NSM detection.
\item False Negative (FN). An alert has incorrectly not been generated when a specific activity has occurred.
\end{list2}

\slide{Detection Capabilities}


Security incidents happen, but what happens. One of the actions to reduce impact of incidents are done in preparing for incidents.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Preparation} for an attack, establish procedures and mechanisms for detecting and responding to attacks
\end{itemize}

Preparation will enable easy {\bf identification} of affected systems, better {\bf containment} which systems are likely to be infected, {\bf eradication} what happened -- how to do the {\bf eradication} and {\bf recovery}.



\slide{Indicators of Compromise and Signatures}

\begin{quote}
An IOC is any piece of information that can be used to objectively describe a
network intrusion, expressed in a platform-independent manner. This could include a simple indicator such as the IP address of a command and control (C2) server or a complex set of behaviors that indicate that a mail server is being used as a malicious SMTP relay.

When an IOC is taken and used in a platform-specific language or format, such as a Snort Rule or a Bro-formatted file, it becomes part of a signature. A signature can contain one or more IOCs.
\end{quote}

\slide{Internet Today}

\hlkimage{10cm}{images/server-client.pdf}

\begin{list2}
\item Clients and servers, roots in the academic world
\item Protocols are old, some more than 20 years
\item Very little is encrypted, mostly HTTPS
\end{list2}



\slide{What is the Internet}

\begin{list1}
\item Communication between humans - currently!
\item Based on TCP/IP
\begin{list2}
\item best effort
\item packet switching (IPv6 calls it packets, not datagram)
\item \emph{connection-oriented} TCP
\item \emph{connection-less} UDP
\end{list2}
\end{list1}

RFC-1958:
\begin{quote}
 A good analogy for the development of the Internet is that of
 constantly renewing the individual streets and buildings of a city,
 rather than razing the city and rebuilding it. The architectural
 principles therefore aim to provide a framework for creating
 cooperation and standards, as a small "spanning set" of rules that
 generates a large, varied and evolving space of technology.
\end{quote}





\slide{OSI and Internet models}

\slide{TCP Transmission Control Protocol}
\hlkimage{12cm}{tcp-1.pdf}

\begin{list1}
\item Connection oriented RFC-791 September 1981, \emph{connection-oriented}
\item Either data delivered in correct order, no data missing, checksum or an error is reported
\item Used for HTTP and others

\slide{Well-known port numbers}

\hlkimage{6cm}{iana1.jpg}

\begin{list1}
\item IANA maintains a list of magical numbers in TCP/IP
\item Lists of protocl numbers, port numers etc.
\item A few notable examples:
\begin{list2}
\item Port 25/tcp Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
\item Port 53/udp and 53/tcp Domain Name System (DNS)
\item Port 80/tcp Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
\item Port 443/tcp HTTP over TLS/SSL (HTTPS)
\end{list2}
\item Source: \link{http://www.iana.org}
\end{list1}



\slide{ICMP Internet Control Message Protocol}

\begin{list1}
\item Control protocol, error messages
\item Common messages
\begin{list2}
\item ICMP ECHO, anyone there?
\item Host unreachable
\item Port unreachable
\end{list2}
\item \emph{signaling}
\item Defined in RFC-792
\end{list1}


\slide{ IPv6 neighbor discovery protocol (NDP)}

\hlkimage{18cm}{ipv6-arp-ndp.pdf}

\begin{list1}
\item Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is gone from IPv6
\item NDP replaces and expand, command to use \verb+arp -an+ replaced by \verb+ndp -an+
\end{list1}



\slide{Basic test tools TCP - Ping and Traceroute}

We should all know
\begin{list2}
\item \verb+ping+ -- like sending a radar ping, anything there
\item \verb+traceroute+ (windows tracert) -- find the route packets traverse
\end{list2}

and add these!
\begin{list2}
\item \verb+Wireshark+ -- like sending a radar ping, anything there
\item \verb+Nmap+ and \verb+Nping+ -- port scan and advanced ping program!
\end{list2}


\slide{Ping}

\begin{alltt}
\small {\bfseries
$ ping 192.168.1.1}
PING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=150 time=8.849 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=150 time=0.588 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=150 time=0.553 ms
\end{alltt}


\begin{list1}
\item ICMP -- Internet Control Message Protocol
\item ECHO -- only ICMP message that generates another
\item ICMP ECHO request sent, and ICMP ECHO reply expected
\item Same with IPv6, \verb+ping6+
\end{list1}


\slide{Network mapping}

\hlkimage{10cm}{images/network-example.pdf}

\begin{list1}
\item Using traceroute and similar programs it is often possible to make educated guess to network topology
\item Time to live (TTL) for packets are decreased when crossing a router
\item when it reaches zero the packet is timed out, and ICMP message sent back to source
\item Default Unix traceroute uses UDP, Windows tracert use ICMP
\end{list1}


\slide{traceroute}

\begin{alltt}
\small{\bfseries
hkj@bob:~$ traceroute www.kramse.dk}
traceroute to www.kramse.dk (185.129.60.130), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets

 9  * * * // firewall here!
\end{alltt}

\begin{list1}
\item Works using the Time to live (TTL) counter
\item Sending with $TTL=1$ returns ICMP from first host/router
\item Default sends UDP on Unix, and ICMP on Windows
\item Kali has programs that can emulate, or send using any protocol
\end{list1}

\verb+tshark -z expert -r download-slow.pcapng+

\item Remote packet dumps, \verb+tcpdump –i eth0 –w packets.pcap+

\item Story: tcpdump was originally written in 1988 by Van Jacobson, Sally Floyd, Vern Paxson and Steven McCanne who were, at the time, working in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Network Research Group\\

\centerline{\Large Great network security comes from knowing networks!}





\slide{Note About Hardware IPv4 checksum offloading}

\begin{list1}
\item IPv4 checksum must be calculated for every packet received
\item IPv4 checksum must be calculated for every packet sent\\
Usually on a router the Time To Live is decremented, to need re-calculation
\vskip 1cm
\item Let an ASIC chip on the network card do the work!
\item Most server network chips today support this and more
\item Benefit for performance, but beware when using security tools
\item If every packet in wireshark has wrong checksum, its the network card doing it
\item Can be turned off, when doing security work
\end{list1}

\slide{The Zeek Network Security Monitor}

\hlkimage{14cm}{zeek-overview.png}

The Zeek Network Security Monitor is not a single tool, more of a

\item NetFlow sampling is vital information - 123Mbit, but what kind of traffic
\item Currently also investigating sFlow - hopefully more fine grained
\end{slidelist}



\slide{View data efficiently}

\hlkimage{10cm}{logstash-search.png}

\begin{list1}

\slide{Summary, what to log}

\begin{list1}
\item CIP 7 Tools of the Trade, need to know NetFlow, DNS, and HTTP proxy logs in the real-world
\begin{list2}
\item Defense in Depth -- we will never catch everything
\item Log Management: The Security Event Data Warehouse
\item Intrusion Detection Isn’t Dead
\item DNS, the One True King -- Logging and analyzing DNS transactions, Blocking DNS requests or responses
\item HTTP Is the Platform: Web Proxies -- Web proxies allow you to solve additional security problems
\item Rolling Packet Capture -- In a perfect world, we would have full packet capture everywhere
\end{list2}
\end{list1}


\slide{Commercial Support}

You can and should use updated rulesets for Suricata.

I Recommend the Emerging Threats ET Pro ruleset, which is about USD 900 per year per sensor. So two sites with Suricata running in both, 2x USD 900

\slide{Summary}

We started from a basic Ubuntu/Debian server, and using Zeek and Suricata we now know more about our network.

We can collect logs about network traffic based on generic NetFlow, specific types DNS/TLS/protocols, and traffic matching advanced rulesets.

We know it is possible to create dashboards and visualizing the data.

What are the next steps?

\slide{Security devops}

\begin{list1}
\item We need devops skillz in security
\item automate, security is also big data
\item integrate tools, transfer, sort, search, pattern matching, statistics, ...
\item tools, languages, databases, protocols, data formats
\item Use GitHub! So many libraries and programs that can help, maybe solve  90\% of your problem, and you can glue the rest together
\item Example introductions:
\begin{list2}
\item Seven languages/database/web frameworks in Seven Weeks
\item Elasticsearch the definitive guide
\end{list2}
\end{list1}

\centerline{We are all Devops now, even security people!}

\slide{Reading Summary}

\begin{quote}
ANSM chapter (7,8),9,10 - 140 pages\\
DETECTION MECHANISMS\\
Generally, detection is a function of software that parses through collected data in order to generate alert data. This software is referred to as a detection mechanism.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Chapter 7 Detection Mechanisms, Indicators of Compromise, and Signatures\\
Chapter 8 Reputation-Based Detection\\
Chapter 9 Signature-Based Detection with Snort and Suricata\\{\bf
Chapter 10 The Bro Platform} // Now Zeek
\end{quote}

Zeek in the default configuration activates 10.000s of script lines out-of-the-box.\\
Gives great output with little effort and complements Suricata/NIDS



\slide{Reading Summary, continued}

\hlkimage{6cm}{zeek-ids.png}

\begin{list1}
\item ANSM chapter 7: Detection Mechanisms and Indicators of Compromise, and Signatures

\begin{list2}
\item Indicators of Compromise (IOC) any piece of information that can be used to objectively describe a
network intrusion, expressed in a platform-independent manner
\item Background information, useful when we talk about Zeek (previously Bro) later
\item Intrusion Detection Systems try to detect ... but what if we know that some domains, servers, IPs etc are signs of bad activity - even compromise
\item IP reputation - some IPs are used for controlling malware command and control (C2) servers etc.
\item A signature can contain one or more IOCs
\end{list2}
\end{list1}

%\hlkimage{7cm}{NSM_Phases-300x238.png}

\begin{list1}
\item ANSM chapter 8: Reputation-Based Detection
\begin{list2}
\item The most basic form of intrusion detection is reputation-based detection
\item Similar concept to block lists for SMTP spam relays
\item I often recommend \link{https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail} as a source of lists
\item Other sources are lists like RIPE NCC delegated, which IP prefixes are handed out in different countries\\
\link{https://ftp.ripe.net/pub/stats/ripencc/delegated-ripencc-extended-latest}\\
\verb+ripencc|DK|ipv4|185.129.60.0|1024|20151130|allocated|+
\item Mentions SiLK \link{https://tools.netsa.cert.org/silk/}\\
If we end up having time today, or another day, we should look into this tool chain also!
