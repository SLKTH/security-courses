\slide{Serialization}

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}
In computing, {\bf serialization (or serialisation)} is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer) or transmitted (for example, {\bf across a network connection link) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment)}.[1] When the resulting series of bits is reread according to the serialization format, it can be used to create a semantically identical clone of the original object. For many complex objects, such as those that make extensive use of references, this process is not straightforward. Serialization of object-oriented objects does not include any of their associated methods with which they were previously linked.
\begin{list2}
\item Java can do this with \verb+Serializable+ - for example writing objects to file and reading them again
\end{list2}

\slide{Marshalling used for RPC}

\begin{quote}
In computer science, {\bf marshalling or marshaling} is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format suitable for storage or transmission, and it is typically used when data must be moved between different parts of a computer program or from one program to another. {\bf Marshalling is similar to serialization} and is used to communicate to remote objects with an object, in this case a serialized object. It simplifies complex communication, using composite objects in order to communicate instead of primitives. The inverse of marshalling is called unmarshalling (or demarshalling, similar to deserialization).
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
  \item marshaling is about getting parameters from here to there
  \item while serialization is about copying structured data to or from a primitive form such as a byte stream
  \item serialization is one means to perform marshaling, usually implementing pass-by-value semantics.

.
\hlkrightpic{14cm}{0cm}{compare-osi-ip.png}

\begin{quote}
External Data Representation (XDR) is a standard data serialization format, for uses such as computer network protocols. It allows data to be transferred between different kinds of computer systems. Converting from the local representation to XDR is called encoding. Converting from XDR to the local representation is called decoding.

\slide{MessagePack}

\begin{quote}
MessagePack is a computer data interchange format. It is a binary form for representing simple data structures like arrays and associative arrays. MessagePack aims to be as compact and simple as possible. The official implementation is available in a variety of languages such as C, C++, C\#, D, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Lua, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala, Smalltalk, and Swift.[1]{\bf

Data structures processed by MessagePack loosely correspond to those used in JSON format.}
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item MessagePack is more compact than JSON, but imposes limitations on array and integer sizes
\item Allows binary data and non UTF-8 encoded strings
\item MessagePack is designed for efficient transmission over the wire

\slide{gRPC}

\begin{quote}
gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls[1]) is an open source remote procedure call (RPC) system initially developed at Google in 2015[2]. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts. It generates cross-platform client and server bindings for many languages. Most common usage scenarios include connecting services in microservices style architecture and connect mobile devices, browser clients to backend services.[3]

\slide{Protobuf used in gRPC}

\begin{quote}
Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
\end{quote}

    MOBILE = 0;
    HOME = 1;
    WORK = 2;
  }

person.set_email("jdoe@example.com");
fstream output("myfile", ios::out | ios::binary);
person.SerializeToOstream(&output);
\end{minted}

Then, later on, you could read your message back in:
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{c++}
fstream input("myfile", ios::in | ios::binary);

\slide{Why protobuf?}

\begin{quote}
Protocol buffers have many advantages over XML for serializing structured data. Protocol buffers:

\begin{list2}
\item are simpler
\item are 3 to 10 times smaller
\item are 20 to 100 times faster
\item are less ambiguous
\item generate data access classes that are easier to use programmatically
\end{list2}

When this message is encoded to the protocol buffer binary format (the text format above is just a convenient human-readable representation for debugging and editing), it would probably be 28 bytes long and take around 100-200 nanoseconds to parse. The XML version is at least 69 bytes if you remove whitespace, and would take around 5,000-10,000 nanoseconds to parse.

\slide{Apache Thrift}


\begin{quote}
  The Apache Thrift software framework, for scalable cross-language services development, combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C\#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and Delphi and other languages.
...
Apache Thrift allows you to define data types and service interfaces in a simple definition file. Taking that file as input, the compiler generates code to be used to easily build RPC clients and servers that communicate seamlessly across programming languages.

\item Web service contracts can be designed to accurately represent the context and function of their corresponding service candidates.
\item Conventions can be applied to Web service operation names to produce standardized endpoint definitions.
\item The granularity of operations can be modeled in abstract to provide consistent and predictable API designs that also establish a message size and volume ratio suitable for the target communications infrastructure.
\item Service consumers are required to conform to the expression of the service contract, not vice versa.
\item The design of business-centric Web service contracts can be assisted by business analysts who may be able to help establish an accurate expression of business
logic.

\slide{Apply Naming Standards}

\begin{quote}\footnotesize
\begin{list2}\footnotesize
\item Service candidates with high reuse potential should always be stripped of any naming characteristics that hint at the business processes for which
they were originally built. For example, instead of naming an operation
GetTimesheetSubmissionID, it can be simply reduced to GetTimesheetID or
even just GetID.
\item Entity services need to remain representative of the entity models from which their corresponding service candidates were derived. Therefore, the naming conventions used must reflect those established in the organizationâ€™s original entity models. Typically, this type of service uses the noun-only naming structure. Examples of suitable entity service names are Invoice, Customer, and Employee.
\item Service operations for entity services should be verb-based and should not repeat the entity name. For example, an entity service called Invoice should not have an operation named AddInvoice.
\item Utility services need to be named according to the processing context under which their operations are grouped. Both the verb+noun or noun only conventions can be used. Simplifi ed examples of suitable utility service names are
CustomerDataAccess, SalesReporting, and GetStatistics.
\item Utility service operations need to clearly communicate the nature of their individual functionality. Examples of suitable utility service operation names are GetReport, ConvertCurrency, and VerifyData.
\item While microservices are not always subjected to the same design standards as agnostic services, it is still recommended that the conventions for service and operation names be applied consistently to whatever extent possible.
\end{list2}

Whatever naming standards are chosen, the key is that they must be consistently
applied throughout all services within a given service inventory.

\begin{quote}{\bf
Design Web Service Operations to Be Inherently Extensible}\\
Regardless of how well services are designed when first deployed, they can never be fully prepared for what the future holds. Some types of business process changes result in the need for the scope of entities to be broadened. As a result, corresponding business services may need to be extended. While the application of Service Reusability (295) and Service Composability (302) are thought through when partitioning logic as part of the service modeling process, extensibility is more of a physical design quality that needs to be considered during design.

REST service contracts are typically designed around the primary functions of HTTP methods, which make the documentation and expression of REST service contracts distinctly different from operation-based Web service contracts. Regardless of the differences in notation, the same overarching contract-first approach to designing REST service contracts is paramount when building services for a standardized service inventory.

\slide{Idempotence}

\begin{quote}
Idempotence (UK: /ËŒÉªdÉ›mËˆpoÊŠtÉ™ns/,[1] US: /ËŒaÉªdÉ™m-/)[2] is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. The concept of idempotence arises in a number of places in abstract algebra (in particular, in the theory of projectors and closure operators) and functional programming (in which it is connected to the property of referential transparency).

The term was introduced by Benjamin Peirce[3] in the context of elements of algebras that remain invariant when raised to a positive integer power, and literally means "(the quality of having) the same power", from idem + potence (same + power).
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item The term idempotent is used multiple times regarding REST and HTTP methods.
\end{list2}

Source: {\footnotesize\\
\link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence}}

\slide{Computer science examples}

\begin{quote}
A function looking up a customer's name and address in a database is typically idempotent, since this will not cause the database to change. Similarly, changing a customer's address to XYZ is typically idempotent, because the final address will be the same no matter how many times XYZ is submitted.
...

In the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), idempotence and safety are the major attributes that separate HTTP verbs. Of the major HTTP verbs, GET, PUT, and DELETE should be implemented in an idempotent manner according to the standard, but POST need not be.[15] GET retrieves a resource; PUT stores content at a resource; and DELETE eliminates a resource.
...

In service-oriented architecture (SOA), a multiple-step orchestration process composed entirely of idempotent steps can be replayed without side-effects if any part of that process fails.

\begin{quote}
Data format â€” Integrated applications must agree on the format of the data they exchange, or must have an intermediate traslator to unify applications that insist on different data formats. A related issue is data format evolution and extensibilityâ€”how the format can change over time and how that will affect the applications.

\begin{quote}
Data or functionality â€” Integrated applications may not want to simply share data, they may wish to share functionality such that each application can invoke the functionality in the others. Invoking functionality remotely can be difficult to achieve, and even though it may seem the same as invoking local functionality, it works quite differently, with significant consequences for how well the integration works.

Remote Communication / Asynchronicity â€” Computer processing is typically synchronous, such that a procedure waits while its subprocedure executes. Itâ€™s a given that the subprocedure is available when the procedure wants to invoke it. However, a procedure may not want to wait for the subprocedure to execute; it may want to invoke the subprocedure asynchronously, starting the subprocedure but then letting it execute in the background. This is especially true of integrated applications, where the remote application may not be running or the network may be unavailableâ€”the source application may wish to simply make shared data available or log a request for a subprocedure call, but then go on to other work confident that the remote application will act sometime later.

\slide{Shared Database}

\hlkimage{7cm}{SharedDatabaseIntegration.png}

Shared Database â€” Have the applications store the data they wish to share in a common database.

Common systems and technologies used:
\begin{list2}
\item database management system (DBMS) using Structured Query Language (SQL), relational database examples:\\
\item PostgresSQL, Oracle DM, Microsoft SQL, MySQL
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL}
\item NoSQL databases has been a new input with examples like:
MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis, RIAK\\

\slide{Chapter 10: Service API and Contract Versioning\\
with Web Services and REST Services}

\begin{quote}
After a service contract is deployed, consumer programs will naturally begin forming dependencies on it. When we are subsequently forced to make changes to the contract, we need to figure out:
\begin{list2}
\item Whether the changes will negatively impact existing (and potentially future) service consumers
\item How changes that will and will not impact consumers should be implemented and communicated
\end{list2}
\end{quote}

Included in the chapter are references to:
\begin{list2}
\item Versioning Web Services
\item Versioning REST Services
\item Fine and Coarse-Grained Constraints

\slide{Versioning and Compatibility}

\begin{list2}
\item Backwards Compatibility\\
A backwards-compatible change to a REST-compliant service contract might involve adding some new resources or adding new capabilities to existing resources. In each of these cases the existing service consumers will only invoke the old methods on the old resources, which continue to work as they previously did.
\item Forwards Compatibility\\
When a service contract is designed in such a manner so that it can support a range of future consumer programs, it is considered to have an extent of forwards compatibility. This means that the contract can essentially accommodate how consumer programs will evolve over time.
\end{list2}

\slide{Incompatible Changes}

\begin{list2}
\item Compatible Changes vs Incompatible Changes\\
If after a change a contract is no longer compatible with consumers, then it is considered to have received an incompatible change. These are the types of changes that can break an existing contract and therefore impose the most challenges when it comes to versioning.

\slide{10.4 Version Identifiers}

\begin{quote}
Versions are almost always communicated with version numbers. The most common
format is a decimal, followed by a period and then another decimal, as shown here: version="2.0"
\end{quote}

From a compatibility perspective, we can associate additional meaning to these numbers. Specifically, the following convention has emerged in the industry:
\begin{list2}
\item A minor version is expected to be backwards-compatible with other minor versions associated with a major version. For example, version 5.2 of a program should be fully backwards-compatible with versions 5.0 and 5.1.
\item A major version is generally expected to break backwards compatibility with programs that belong to other major versions. This means that program version 5.0 is not expected to be backwards-compatible with version 4.0.
\end{list2}

\slide{Appendix B: REST Constraints Reference}

\begin{quote}
This appendix provides profile tables for the REST constraints referenced throughout this book
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Client-Server \emph{Solution logic is separated into consumer and service logic that share a technical contract.}
\item Stateless \emph{Services remain stateless between request/response message exchanges with service consumers.}
\item Cache \emph{Service consumers can cache and reuse response message data.}
\item Uniform Contract \emph{Service consumers and services share a common, overarching, generic technical contract.}
\item  Layered System \emph{A solution can be comprised of multiple architectural layers.}
\item Code-on-Demand \emph{Service consumers support the execution of deferred service logic.}
\end{list2}
