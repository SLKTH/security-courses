## 2) Security Policies / Confidentiality Policies
Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
Access Control Matrix
Security policy

Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
Acceptable Use Policies
Example Academic Computer Security Policy from the book
Example SELinux

## 3) Integrity and Availability Policies
Accuracy vs disclosure
The Biba Model
Clark-Wilson Integrity Model
Lipners Integrity Matrix Model
Trust models
Deadlocks, DBMS, databases, Postgresql
Availability and flooding attacks, Protection against TCP Synfloods

## 4) Hybrid Policies / Breaking out
Chinese Wall model - Confidentiality and Integrity
Clinical Information Systems security model
Originator Controlled Access Control
Role-based Access Control (RBAC), example Github
Break-the-glass Policies
Side Channels and Deducibility
